Notes for Chapter 1: Arithmetic

Real world data -->  programmer must learn to compose basic data and describe such compositions.

Operations on data --> program must learn to compose these operations into a program that performs desired computations.

p. 34: Critical for a programmer to know how the chosen language calculates.

primitive operatiosn = pre-defined operations. 

ATOMIC DATA - numbers, strings, images and Booleans
  * Can't "peek inside" atomic data, but you can operate on them.

p. 36 Exact vs inexact numbers 

Exercise 1:
(define x 3)
(define y 4)
(define (dist x y) (sqrt (+ (* x x) (* y y))))
